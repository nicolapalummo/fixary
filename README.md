# Fixary ⚡️
**The Simplest Auditor for Vibe Coders.**

> Turn your AI-generated MVP into an Enterprise-grade product.

## The Era of Vibe Coding
We are in the golden age of creation. With tools like **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and **Replit**, anyone can turn a prompt into an app in hours.
But speed comes with a hidden tax: **Security Debt**.

AI models hallucinate. They introduce vulnerabilities, use deprecated libraries, and write unscalable logic. You might vibe-code your way to an MVP, but you can't vibe-code your way through a security breach or an App Store rejection.

## Enter Fixary
Fixary is the reality check for the AI coding generation. It is a **Hybrid Auditor** that combines mathematical precision with semantic understanding to secure your codebase in seconds.

### The Hybrid Engine
We don’t rely on a single layer of analysis. We use a dual-engine approach:

#### 1. The Deterministic Layer (Certainty) 📐
Running parallel to independent logic, our Static Analysis Engine parses your Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to enforce mathematical certainties.
*   **What it catches:** SQL Injections, Hardcoded Secrets, Infinite Loops, Dangerous `eval()` usage.
*   **Philosophy:** If X exists structurally, flag it. Zero probability involved.

#### 2. The Audit-Trained LLM (Intuition) 🧠
An AI model fine-tuned specifically on high-quality code audits and security reports. It reads your repository to grasp architecture, intent, and "code smells."
*   **What it catches:** Spaghetti code, incoherent logic, unscalable patterns, business logic flaws.
*   **Philosophy:** Understand the "Why," not just the "How."

#### 3. Agentic Synthesis (Velocity) ⚡️
We don't just dump a PDF of errors on you. Our Agent merges findings from both layers, filters false positives, and generates **ready-to-paste fixes**.

## The Process
**Paste. Scan. Fix.**

1.  **Paste**: Drop your GitHub repository link. No installation required.
2.  **Scan**: Our Hybrid Engine analyzes every line of code in an ephemeral environment.
3.  **Fix**: receive a prioritized report with one-click code solutions.

## Privacy First 🔒
Your code is your IP. We treat it that way.

*   **Ephemeral by Design**: Analysis runs in isolated memory containers that are wiped instantly after specific execution.
*   **End-to-End Encrypted**: Bank-grade SSL/TLS protects your code in transit.
*   **No Training**: Your code is **never** used to train our models.
